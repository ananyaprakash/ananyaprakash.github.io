 The essay focused on identifying my ideal leadership style and how it can adapt to various situations. It was based on theories from leadership measures such as DiSC, MBTI and the Big 5 OCEAN. Analysis of my leadership was on self, team and organisational levels of leadership. The entire essay was wrapped in the theme of the flat earth society and comical representations were used to aid the reader in understanding my perception.
