COVID-19 had affected various countries in different ways and several policies were implemented to mitigate the spread of the pandemic.
I aimed to apply data mining techniques on the demographic data of countries and analyze their case history, symptoms identified and mobility activity of the population

Investigated the spread of COVID-19 using data mining techniques such as hierarchical clustering, network clustering and association mining rules. Identified symptoms and activities that propogate COVID-19. 
- Trained a Neural  Network to classify countries into 4 categories based on their pandemic severity level. 
- Performed a comparative analysis between countries with similar COVID-19 history using network clustering. Developed a network using COVID-19 case history to connect the countries (nodes) and populaiton density to set the size of nodes. 
- Compared HK and Singapore since they had similar population density and 3-day increase in cases. Recommended policies that if implemented in HK, could reduce the rise in cases like Singapore successfully did.
- User community detection to identify clusters. Performed cluster-wise analysis of countries and identified policies that could reduce rise in cases for countries performing poorly in cluster.
This helped identify closely connected countries and suggest policy implementations based on effective policies of node neighbor countries.
