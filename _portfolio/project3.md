Built a directed weighted graph based on Granger Causality to find influencing markets and sub-communities. Hub nodes were identified with potential to destabilize world markets. Community detection revealed the potential impact of financial crises on global trade. This project also helped understand the trade implications caused by lockdowns in a globalized world.
