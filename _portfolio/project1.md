<!-- Developed a robust facial recognition system that recognizes masked faces with 77% accuracy. Used image augmentation, feature extraction, and multi-class classification using SVM to develop the recognition engine.  -->
Situation: Facial recognition systems were performing poorly on masked faces with accuracy reduced up to 50%
Task: develop a masked facial recognition access control system for contactless access to restricted facilities in university, hospitals, etc.
Action:

Curated a custom dataset of masked faces
Developed an end-to-end access control system facilitating enrollment and recognition of users
MTCNN for image preprocessing, FACENET to extract embeddings, trained using KNN classifier 

Results: Achieved 77% accuracy on masked faces and 95% accuracy on unmasked faces. Implemented hardware demonstration using Raspberry pi.   Hyperlink: FYP video [from Drive]
