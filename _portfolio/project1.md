Existing facial recognition systems were performing poorly on masked faces with accuracy reduced up to 50%. Developed a masked facial recognition access control system for contactless access to restricted facilities in university, hospitals, etc. 
- Curated a custom dataset of masked faces form university students
- Used image augementation techniques to create variation in brightness, contrast and noise in images. 
- Generated images with a variety of patterned masks to reduce homogeneity in dataset.
- Extracted feature embeddings form pre-processed images to train a  multi-class classifier.
- Developed a recognition engine with 77% accuracy on masked faces and 99% accurcay on unmasked faces. 
- Implemented hardware demonstration using Raspberry pi.
