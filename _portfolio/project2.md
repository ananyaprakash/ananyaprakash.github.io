<!-- Conceptualized a research study to analyze the effect of mental health and therapy accounts on Instagram. Contributed to the project by extracting and analyzing data of the accounts on the basis of followers, content type, activity and engagement. Performed content analysis using hashtag entropy and Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling.   -->
Situation: COVID-19 had affected various countries in different ways and several policies were implemented to mitigate the spread of the pandemic.

Task: Apply data mining techniques on the demographic data of countries and analyze their case history, symptoms identified and mobility activity 

Action: developed an information network of countries using case history and population density and suggested policies that could abate rise in cases based on policies implemented by connected nodes that were successful at reducing the spread

Result:
Compared HK and Singapore since they had similar population density and 3-day increase in cases. Recommended policies that if implemented in HK, could reduce the rise in cases like Singapore successfully did.
User community detection to identify clusters. Performed cluster-wise analysis of countries and identified policies that could reduce rise in cases for countries performing poorly in cluster.
