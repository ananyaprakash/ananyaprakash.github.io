Final project for computer music course using video and audio manipulation. 

Concept: maestro conducting the battle between two wizards( Gandalf from lord of the rings and dumbledore from harry potter)
Visual effects employed: Green screening, reverse, video overlay. The visuals were compiled on iMovie.

Audio effects: used various instruments to attach sound effects to a MIDI file of the harry potter theme to coincide with the visuals. Added instruments such as bells, trumpets, a string ensemble and a choir, all of which increase the impact of the visuals. The music synthesis was done on garageBand
